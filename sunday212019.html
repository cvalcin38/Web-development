<h1>JEFF'S SCHOOL OF PROGRAMMING</h1>

<H2>Reasons for attending this school:</H2>


<body>
 <p>This school, founded by Jeff Destine,<br>
    has been in existence since 2018. <br>
    There has been several individuals who<br> 
    have attended this school. Because it is <br>
    offered at no cost to anyone, many of the <br>
    young people who were in attendance didn't <br>
    appreciate the sacrifice that the professor was <br>
    making to offer these courses. However, a group <br>
    of old folks from the <em>Hempstead Sda Church</em>have decided <br>
    to attend the courses.
